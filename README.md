# Project1
## I started by connecting my instance to my terminal to access the ubuntu. 
![Instance connected to my terminal](https://github.com/Chinyereonyenwe34/Project1/assets/132712031/ff56963c-e92b-493f-a71b-6db2d114eb0a)
After that i proceeded to install my apache by running the command sudo apt install apache2. I followed by running the update and upgrade commands, which are sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade respectively. 
I tested it to make sure the apache was running by running the command sudo systemctl status apache2. It showed me a green color and the caption "running"
