## I started by connecting my instance to my terminal to access the ubuntu.

After that i proceeded to install my apache by running the command sudo apt install apache2. I followed by running the update and upgrade commands, which are sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade respectively. 
I tested it to make sure the apache was running by running the command sudo systemctl status apache2. It showed me a green color and the caption "running"
